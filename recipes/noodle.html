    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This recipe is taken from Miguel Barclayâ€™s Vegan One Pound Meals, you can listen to him talk about this recipe and others on the Cook Smart podcast.</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter and Milk (France) To give your noodle recipe a French twist, all you'll need are two ingredients: ðŸ§ˆbutter and ðŸ¥› milk. ...</li>
        <li>Fried Bacon and Egg (USA) .</li>
        <li>Peanut Butter and Sriracha Sauce (Thailand) ...</li>
        <li>Sesame Oil and Soy Sauce (Japan) ..</li>
        <li>Garlic and Soy Sauce (China) ...</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>First rinse and shred or chop all the veggies, then set aside. You will need 1 cup shredded cabbage, Â½ shredded carrots, 8 to 10 french beans (thinly sliced or finely chopped), â…“ sliced capsicum and â…“ cup chopped spring onion whites.</li>
        <li>Next heat 5 to 6 cups of water in a pan.</li>
        <li>Then when the water comes to a boil, add Â½ teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li> Next add Â½ teaspoon oil and mix well. Add any neutral oil.</li>
        <li>Then add the noodles (about 200 grams). I have used whole wheat noodles. The recipe is customizable with any noodles â€“ instant, ramen, soba, chow mein, udon, rice.</li>
        <li>Now boil until the noodles are cooked al dente.

        </li>
        <li>Be sure to check the doneness throughout the noodles recipe by pressing a few noodles or tasting them. They should be softened, but still have a slight bite to them.</li>
        <li>Then drain the cooked noodles in a colander or sieve.

        </li>
        <li>Next rinse the noodles with fresh water.</li>
        <li>After that, set aside. You can even toss the noodles recipe with 2 to 3 teaspoons oil if desired.</li>
        

    </ol>
